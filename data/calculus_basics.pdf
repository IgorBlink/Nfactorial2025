# Calculus Basics - Study Material

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Calculus

### What is Calculus?
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with continuous change. It has two main branches:
- **Differential Calculus**: Studies rates of change (derivatives)
- **Integral Calculus**: Studies accumulation of quantities (integrals)

### Historical Context
Calculus was developed independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century.

## Chapter 2: Limits and Continuity

### Definition of a Limit
The limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a value a is the value that f(x) gets arbitrarily close to as x gets arbitrarily close to a.

Notation: lim[x→a] f(x) = L

### Properties of Limits
1. **Sum Rule**: lim[x→a] (f(x) + g(x)) = lim[x→a] f(x) + lim[x→a] g(x)
2. **Product Rule**: lim[x→a] (f(x) × g(x)) = lim[x→a] f(x) × lim[x→a] g(x)
3. **Quotient Rule**: lim[x→a] (f(x)/g(x)) = lim[x→a] f(x) / lim[x→a] g(x), provided lim[x→a] g(x) ≠ 0

### Continuity
A function f(x) is continuous at x = a if:
1. f(a) is defined
2. lim[x→a] f(x) exists
3. lim[x→a] f(x) = f(a)

## Chapter 3: Derivatives

### Definition of Derivative
The derivative of a function f(x) at point x is defined as:
f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

### Common Derivative Rules
1. **Power Rule**: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
2. **Product Rule**: d/dx(uv) = u'v + uv'
3. **Quotient Rule**: d/dx(u/v) = (u'v - uv')/v²
4. **Chain Rule**: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) × g'(x)

### Applications of Derivatives
- Finding rates of change
- Optimization problems
- Related rates
- Linear approximation

## Chapter 4: Integrals

### Definite vs Indefinite Integrals

#### Indefinite Integral
An indefinite integral represents a family of functions whose derivative is the given function.
∫ f(x) dx = F(x) + C, where F'(x) = f(x) and C is the constant of integration.

#### Definite Integral
A definite integral represents the signed area under a curve between two specific points.
∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a), where F'(x) = f(x)

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects derivatives and integrals:

**Part 1**: If f is continuous on [a,b] and F(x) = ∫[a to x] f(t) dt, then F'(x) = f(x)

**Part 2**: If f is continuous on [a,b] and F is any antiderivative of f, then ∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

### Integration Techniques
1. **Substitution**: Used when the integrand contains a function and its derivative
2. **Integration by Parts**: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du
3. **Partial Fractions**: For rational functions
4. **Trigonometric Substitution**: For integrals involving √(a² - x²), √(a² + x²), or √(x² - a²)

## Chapter 5: Important Theorems

### Mean Value Theorem
If f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that:
f'(c) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)

**Geometric Interpretation**: There exists at least one point where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line connecting the endpoints.

### Rolle's Theorem
If f is continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and f(a) = f(b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that f'(c) = 0.

### Intermediate Value Theorem
If f is continuous on [a,b] and k is any value between f(a) and f(b), then there exists at least one point c in [a,b] such that f(c) = k.

## Chapter 6: Applications

### Optimization Problems
Steps to solve optimization problems:
1. Identify the quantity to be optimized
2. Express this quantity as a function of one variable
3. Find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero
4. Test critical points and endpoints to find maximum or minimum

### Related Rates
Problems involving rates of change of related quantities:
1. Identify all variables and their relationships
2. Write an equation relating the variables
3. Differentiate both sides with respect to time
4. Substitute known values and solve

### Area and Volume Applications
- Area between curves: ∫[a to b] |f(x) - g(x)| dx
- Volume by disk method: V = π∫[a to b] [R(x)]² dx
- Volume by washer method: V = π∫[a to b] ([R(x)]² - [r(x)]²) dx
- Volume by shell method: V = 2π∫[a to b] x × f(x) dx
